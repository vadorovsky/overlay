Subject: [PATCH] build: Don't add `-latomic` for clang

compiler-rt supports `__atomic_is_lock_free` since LLVM 12[0]. Requiring
`-latomic` on clang builds introduces a dependency on libgcc, which is
often undesirable on LLVM-based build environments. This change makes
sure it's never added in clang builds, so it can use the compiler-rt's
implementation.
